# Description

* In this example, a folder containing many **.sgf files** which are not readable by Python inbuilt functions is passed through the extraction.py code. The program will first **convert** the files into **.txt extension**, and then read them one by one and **extract values** correspond to **"PB""PW""RE"** using **Regular Expression** and arrange them as pairs into an **array** and create a **.cvs file** as output for better **visualisation** of the data.
